<p>Let's use this example from <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/periodic.html">Bokeh documentation</a> to display an interactive Periodic Table of Elements.</p>
<p>A standard Bokeh workflow for displaying plots inline in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab goes like this:
1) call <code>output_notebook()</code>,
2) construct our plot object <code>p</code>,
3) pass the plot object into <code>show()</code>.</p>
<p>The plots show up in the notebook but do not survive the process of conversion to a static HTML page.  What do we do?</p>
<p>Using <code>components</code>, we can extract the JS and HTML snippets.  Then we recombine them into one JS+HTML chunk with f-string formatting, and render the plot with the help of <code>IPython.display</code>.</p>
